this is a collaborative recipe book for me and my friends to use!

i built it with svelte and sveltekit. it uses a posgreSQL database with prisma to store recipes. if you find any issues, i'd appreciate if you let me know about them ~ this is my first website i have built besides my simple little index page.

## playing with it 
if you wanna play around with this, make sure to run 

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

this will install all required dependencies, and start a local development server.

## thanks to !
